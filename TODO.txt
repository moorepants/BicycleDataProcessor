- Split runs with multiple perturbations
- The time sync didn't work on run 466-470
- The lateral force is not always centered at zero, for example # 486, need a
  way to fix that
- 158, 159, 162, 163, 167, 168 should be "Balance"
- I'm missing videos 295-325
- The knee does not seem to come off in Run 309, change the note
- Run 584 Charlie forgot to hold his knees in, it is a nice demo of how much we
  move our knees laterally
- Check the time syncrhonization on runs 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 433, 436,
  437, 439, 451
